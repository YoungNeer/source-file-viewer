## So what is Source_File_Viewer?

When you have a lots of .cpp/.c++ files i.e. c++ source files and all under one folder and you have that stupid a.out file.
Ofcourse you cannot know which source file's binary is that just by looking at that. But you can know just by typing its name (the binary file's - here a.out)
and tada .. you have the name of your input file

### Still haven't understood?

See the screenshot then:

<b>P.S.</b> It only works for c++ source files and only on LINUX/UNIX I believe
